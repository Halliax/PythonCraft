Right now it generates the world on the fly and launches the pyglet window as soon as it's been generated, so just run main.py with Python. \r\n\r\nThe current version uses textures from Mojang's Minecraft, and certain elements of the program structure were inspired by Michael Fogleman's \"Minecraft\" repository.\r\n\r\n#### Dependencies:\r\n* Pyglet\r\n* Numpy\r\n* PyPlatec\r\n\r\n`pip install pyglet numpy pyplatec`\r\n\r\n#### Controls:\r\n__WASD:__ Normal movement\r\n__Space:__ Fly up\r\n__Shift:__ Fly down\r\n__Esc:__ Pause",
