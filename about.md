### Inspiration

Better than Earth was initially conceived with the intention of making a "Minecraft clone" in Python. After some ideation, we decided to shift focus away from making an interactive game and move toward making a simulation with realistic and detailed terrain generation. 

### The Team

* Sam "4CORe" Myers - Worked mainly on rendering, went through great pains to learn OpenGL for this project. Having managed to render thousands of cubes, he is reluctant to mess with success and touch that code again.

* Taylor "Shenemesh" Sheneman - Worked on erosion algorithms and plate tectonics. Taylor is passionate about meshes and aspires to be better than Minecraft in all aspects of his life.

* Willem "Spleen" Thorbecke - Worked on diamond-square and fractal algorithms, as well as cave generation. Will is passionate about planes, specifically as an avenue to view terrain in interesting ways, and has been eager to give Sam credit for his ability to draw squares.
