### Inspiration

Better than Earth was initially conceived with the intention of making a "Minecraft clone" in Python. After some ideation, we decided to shift focus away from making an interactive game and move toward making a simulation with realistic and detailed terrain generation. 

### The Team

* Sam "4CORe" Myers - Worked mainly on rendering and memory management, and is devoted to the pain of OpenGL and vertex transformations. Having managed to render thousands of cubes, he is reluctant to mess with success and make the world not look like Minecraft.

* Taylor "Shenemesh" Sheneman - Worked primarily on erosion algorithms and plate tectonics, striving to ensure the program runs on nothing less than a supercomputer. Taylor zealously pursues bothering Sam about meshes and aspires to be better than Minecraft in all aspects of his life.

* Willem "Spleen" Thorbecke - Worked on diamond-square and fractal algorithms, as well as cave generation. Will is passionate about planes, specifically as an avenue to view terrain in interesting ways, and has been eager to give Sam credit for his ability to draw a square.
